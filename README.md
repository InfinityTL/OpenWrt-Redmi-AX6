## Issues
#### Disclaimer: The following known issues are all personal measurements, and there may be unknown issues. I am not responsible for any issues caused by the firmware

~~* As of the editing of this article, since the memory leak problem of ax6's openwrt is still unresolved, my personal suggestion is to restart every once in a while and add the following commands through the system-startup item-local startup script (note: to exit Before 0):~~
   ```bash
   echo "0 4 * * * sleep 5 && touch /etc/banner && reboot" >> /etc/crontabs/root
   echo "0 16 * * * sleep 5 && touch /etc/banner && reboot" >> /etc/crontabs/root
   ```
   ~~Then restart the router once. It will restart at 4 am and 16 pm every day. If you can understand the principle of crontab, you can also customize the restart time.~~

* (update)The problem of luci stuck due to memory seems to be fixed (I haven't seen luci crash for several days after booting), ~~but due to at least 5.15 kernel, it can't open 160Mhz.~~
* (Update again) If you want to open 160Mhz, please find Generic 802.11acaxn in the network-wireless item, click edit, set the channel to 48 (pro-test available, you can also try other channels), and then set the country to US - United States, save and apply the settings, wait a minute
